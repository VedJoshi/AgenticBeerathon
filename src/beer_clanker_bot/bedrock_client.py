            First, check if the movie is widely associated with an iconic cocktail (e.g., Vesper Martini in Casino Royale, White Russian in The Big Lebowski, French 75 in Casablanca, Cosmopolitan in Sex and the City, Red Eye in Cocktail, Pink Lady in Grease, Blood and Sand in Blood and Sand). If so, OVERRIDE the standard S3 cocktail recommendation, and instead:
