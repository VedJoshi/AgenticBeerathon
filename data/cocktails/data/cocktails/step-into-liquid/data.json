  "description": "Two Wednesdays ago, I returned the online recipe flashcards for the Liholiho Yacht Club in San Francisco that I utilized for the Pineapple Dance, and I landed on the Step into Liquid. As for a time estimate, I was able to spot the drink on a 2019 menu on Yelp, and it was perhaps named after the 2003 surfing documentary. While I have had other pineapple rum-Campari drinks in the Negroni ballpark, like the Pineapple Kingston Negroni, Best Fronds, and Jungle Boulevard, they all called for regular sweet vermouth instead of Punt e Mes. Once prepared, the Step into Liquid offered up orange, dark rum, pineapple, and herbal aromas to the nose. Next, grape and caramel notes on the sip gave way to rum, pineapple, bitter orange, and herbal flavors on the swallow.",

      "description": "Punt e Mes is a bittersweet Italian aperitivo, originating in Turin, Italy. The name itself translates to 'one and two,' referencing the original ratio of sweet vermouth to Campari used in its creation. It's a complex blend of botanicals, spices, and citrus peels, resulting in a uniquely layered flavor profile that balances bitterness with subtle sweetness and aromatic depth. The precise recipe remains a closely guarded secret, but it's known to include ingredients like gentian root, cinchona bark, and various citrus fruits.\n\nPunt e Mes offers a distinctive taste experience, characterized by a pronounced bitterness that isn't overpowering, but rather balanced by a gentle sweetness and a lingering herbal complexity. It's often enjoyed neat or with a splash of soda water, and its versatility lends itself well to experimentation with other mixers. The ingredient is known for its rich texture and full-bodied mouthfeel, making it a satisfying and sophisticated choice for those seeking an alternative to more common aperitifs.\n\nPunt e Mes is a relatively strong aperitivo, reflecting its Campari base. It's a key ingredient for those looking to add a touch of Italian flair to their drinks program, and its unique flavor profile sets it apart from other bitter components.",
