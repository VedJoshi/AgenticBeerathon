It is a dark brown liquid made from a secret blend of herbs and spices, created by the House of Angostura in Trinidad and Tobago. Despite its name, Angostura bitters does not contain angostura bark; instead, it features a proprietary combination of botanical ingredients.\n\nAngostura bitters typically comes in small bottles with a distinctive oversized label and a built-in dasher top, allowing for controlled and precise pouring.\n\nDespite the name, Angostura bitters is non-alcoholic in the sense that it is not consumed in large quantities and is used as a flavoring agent rather than a beverage on its own.\n\nAngostura bitters has become an iconic and essential ingredient in the world of cocktails, appreciated for its ability to elevate and enhance the overall drinking experience.",
