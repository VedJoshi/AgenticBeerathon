Dump the water out of the mug, add the whiskey-sugar mixture and top with boiling water to about 1 inch below the rim of the glass.\n4. Pour the espresso shot directly into the mug.\n5. Float the cream on top and garnish with freshly grated cinnamon.\n\n\n ## Editors note:\n\n### Whipped Heavy Cream:\n\nPour several ounces of heavy cream into a mixing tin.
