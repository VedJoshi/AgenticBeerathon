  "description": "Ernest Hemingway, who stayed in Cuba, tried the Floridita's signature drink, the Floridita Daiquiri, and said \"That's good but I prefer it without sugar and double rum,\" which became a cocktail now known as the Hemingway Daiquiri or the Papa Doble. This recipe was later modified further, adding grapefruit juice to the mix, at which point the drink was dubbed the \"Hemingway Special\".",

      "description": "Dark rum is a type of rum that is aged longer and often in charred barrels, giving it a darker color and a richer, more robust flavor compared to lighter rums. It typically has notes of caramel, molasses, and sometimes spices. Dark rum is commonly used in cocktails, especially those with a strong, flavorful profile, and it is also enjoyed neat or on the rocks. The aging process contributes to the development of complex flavors and a smoother texture.",
