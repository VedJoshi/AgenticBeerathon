  "description": "Sam Ross created a Manhattan/Negroni mash up known as the Left Hand (bourbon whiskey, Campari, sweet vermouth & chocolate bitters) in the early 2000s. Ross wasn't familiar with the Boulevardier (bourbon whiskey, Campari & sweet vermouth) at the time he created it - almost identical ingredients list but the ratios slightly skewed. Sam favoured the 2:1 Manhattan specs in relation to the whiskey and vermouth. It went on to become a modern classic and was part of a series of \"hand\" cocktails that the Milk & Honey team created - The Right Hand featured an aged rum, Tres Hand was made with mezcal and tequila, and the Smoking Hand contained an Islay and Highland whisky.",

Distillation: Bourbon must be distilled to no more than 160 proof (80% alcohol by volume) and entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume).\n\n3. Barrel Aging: Bourbon must be aged in new charred oak barrels. There is no minimum aging requirement for bourbon, but to be labeled as \"straight bourbon,\" it must be aged for at least two years.\n\n4. No Additives: Bourbon must not contain any additives except water to adjust the proof.\n\n5. Bottling Strength: Bourbon must be bottled at a minimum of 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume).\n\n6.
