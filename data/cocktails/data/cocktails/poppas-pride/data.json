Bourbon has a sweet and full-bodied flavor profile.\n\nTo be labeled as bourbon, a whiskey must meet the following criteria:\n\n1. Grain Mash Composition: Bourbon must be made from a grain mash that is at least 51% corn. The remaining portion of the mash can include other grains such as barley, rye, and wheat.\n\n2. Distillation: Bourbon must be distilled to no more than 160 proof (80% alcohol by volume) and entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume).\n\n3. Barrel Aging: Bourbon must be aged in new charred oak barrels. There is no minimum aging requirement for bourbon, but to be labeled as \"straight bourbon,\" it must be aged for at least two years.\n\n4. No Additives: Bourbon must not contain any additives except water to adjust the proof.\n\n5. Bottling Strength: Bourbon must be bottled at a minimum of 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume).\n\n6. Geographic Origin: While bourbon can be produced anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with Kentucky, and many consider Kentucky bourbon to be a distinctive category.",

Also known as soda, siphon soda water, soda water, siphon soda, and siphon water.\n\nSoda water is artificially or naturally carbonated water, to which mineral salts have been added. The product without the salts is termed \"seltzer\" or \"seltzer water.\"\n\nCarbonated water with added minerals—commonly sodium bicarbonate or salt—club soda was designed to approximate mineral water, which is often naturally fizzy, but can carry a hefty price tag. English chemist Joseph Priestly invented the process of carbonation in 1767, when he realized that the carbon dioxide produced during the fermentation of beer could be infused into water. Soon after, Jacob Schweppe, a Swiss watchmaker, figured out how to manufacture carbonated water (which has no added minerals) and club soda. These products would become the cornerstone of the Schweppes Company, which is still in existence today. The added salt or sodium bicarbonate helps to mitigate the sour flavors from the carbonic acid, a byproduct of carbon dioxide.",
