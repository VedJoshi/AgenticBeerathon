To garnish, place a white chocolate eggshell on top of the cocktail.\n\n\n ## Editors note:\n\n### White Chocolate Eggshell\n\nTemper high-quality white chocolate. While the chocolate is heating, blow up water balloons to roughly the size of an extra-large egg, and assemble a cold water bath. \n\nWhen the white chocolate is tempered, dip the balloon halfway and allow the chocolate to drip off, then place directly into the cold water to set.\n\nOnce the chocolate has set, pop the balloon with a paring knife or scissors, and peel it away from the chocolate shell. Chocolate eggs may be stored in the freezer until ready to use.",
