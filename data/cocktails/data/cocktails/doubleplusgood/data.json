  "description": "Doubleplusgood is Boston barman John Gertsen’s take on a Mai Tai, crossed with a Pisco Sour. It’s mildly sweet, with the gentle almond flavor of orgeat laced through the delicate foam of egg white (or aquafaba, if you prefer).\n\nThe garnish is a signature of Gertsen’s recipe: two plus signs, drawn in the foam with aromatic bitters.",
