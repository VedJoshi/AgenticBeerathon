  "description": "Imagine: a view of a sandy beach shore peeking out between dense green vegetation and hovering tree canopies, the faint scent of salt from the sea suspended in the warm breeze, and that electrifying feeling of energy in the air right before a thunderstorm. You take a sip. Crisp. Cold. Tropical. Revitalizing. This is that drink.\n\nChartreuse is the dominant flavor, trailed by a comforting whisper of coconut aroma and the grassy & clean Copalli rum. When recreating, your choice of coconut rum will be pivotal in how the drink turns out; the best coconut rum I can recommend is the Hawaiian-made Koloa rum. More info on this rum can be found here but in short, it’s a fresh, natural, actual RUM that is scented with coconut and not a coconut LIQUEUR like many cloyingly sweet “coconut rums” tend to be.\n\nThis is dangerously easy-drinking for what it is, imbibe responsibly. Chartreuse = 55% Copalli rum = 42%. Koloa coconut rum = 40%.",

      "description": "20% saline\n\nSaline solution, often simply referred to as salt solution, is a mixture of water and sodium chloride (salt). It's a surprisingly versatile ingredient, primarily used to enhance and balance flavors rather than contribute a distinct taste of its own. The precise ratio of salt to water can be adjusted to achieve different levels of intensity, though a standard ratio is typically employed. It's a fundamental component in many culinary applications beyond beverages, often used to season food and create brines.\n\nBeyond its simple composition, saline solution plays a crucial role in manipulating perceived sweetness and acidity. A small addition can soften harsh edges and create a more rounded, palatable experience. It's important to note that the quality of the salt used significantly impacts the final product; finer salts generally dissolve more readily and provide a more consistent result. The ingredient is often used to create a 'salty' rim for glasses, or to add a subtle savory note to drinks.",
