      "description": "A type of American whiskey, primarily made from corn and aged in new charred oak barrels. Bourbon has a sweet and full-bodied flavor profile.\n\nTo be labeled as bourbon, a whiskey must meet the following criteria:\n\n1. Grain Mash Composition: Bourbon must be made from a grain mash that is at least 51% corn. The remaining portion of the mash can include other grains such as barley, rye, and wheat.\n\n2. Distillation: Bourbon must be distilled to no more than 160 proof (80% alcohol by volume) and entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume).\n\n3. Barrel Aging: Bourbon must be aged in new charred oak barrels. There is no minimum aging requirement for bourbon, but to be labeled as \"straight bourbon,\" it must be aged for at least two years.\n\n4. No Additives: Bourbon must not contain any additives except water to adjust the proof.\n\n5. Bottling Strength: Bourbon must be bottled at a minimum of 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume).\n\n6. Geographic Origin: While bourbon can be produced anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with Kentucky, and many consider Kentucky bourbon to be a distinctive category.",

It is produced by the Campari Group and contains a blend of herbs, spices, and botanicals. Aperol is characterized by its lower alcohol content compared to some other aperitifs, making it a popular choice for refreshing cocktails. Aperol's distinct flavor profile and versatility make it a favorite ingredient in a variety of cocktails and spritz variations.\n\nThe labels explicitly credit the product to Barbieri Brothers in 1919, and admit to “an infusion of orange, rhubarb, china and gentian”. (“China” in this case means cinchona.) Today, Aperol is “produced from the original recipe of Barbieri” by Campari, and could be described as “like Campari” but milder, with the orange flavor dominant, and a yellower (orange) color.",
