      "description": "Dark rum is a type of rum that is aged longer and often in charred barrels, giving it a darker color and a richer, more robust flavor compared to lighter rums. It typically has notes of caramel, molasses, and sometimes spices. Dark rum is commonly used in cocktails, especially those with a strong, flavorful profile, and it is also enjoyed neat or on the rocks. The aging process contributes to the development of complex flavors and a smoother texture.",

The liqueur is made from and named after Puebla's renowned ancho chiles, a dried form of ripe poblano peppers.\n\nThe company produces two types of chile liqueur: the original, red Ancho Reyes liqueur and the newer, green Ancho Reyes Verde liqueur. The liqueur is produced using late harvest chiles that have sun-dried for 2 to 3 weeks. For the Verde version of the drink, early harvested fire-roasted poblano chiles are used in addition to the sun-dried chiles.\n\nBoth the red and green liqueurs are 40% ABV and are popular for adding a bit of spice to classic drinks like a margarita or a Paloma.",
