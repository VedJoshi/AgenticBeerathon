      "description": "Rye whiskey is a type of whiskey made primarily from rye grain. To be labeled as rye whiskey in the United States, the mash (grain mixture fermented to make alcohol) must be composed of at least 51% rye. The remaining ingredients in the mash can include other grains such as corn and barley. Rye whiskey is aged in new charred oak barrels, and the final product must be distilled to no more than 160 proof and entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof.\n\nAmerican rye whiskey tends to have a spicier and more robust flavor profile compared to bourbon, which is primarily made from corn.\n\nIn Canada, the term \"rye\" is often used broadly and doesn't necessarily mean that the whiskey is made predominantly from rye grain. Canadian rye whisky can contain a mix of grains, and the flavor profile may vary. Some Canadian whiskies labeled as \"rye\" are made with little or no rye content.\n\nRye whiskey is known for its distinctive taste, which can include spicy, fruity, and sometimes peppery notes. It can be enjoyed neat, on the rocks, or used in various cocktails such as the classic Manhattan or Old Fashioned.",

      "description": "Mezcal is a distilled alcoholic beverage that originates from Mexico, known for its distinctive smoky flavor. It is made from the agave plant, primarily the species Agave espadin, although other agave varieties can be used. The production of mezcal involves roasting the agave hearts (piñas) in underground pits, which imparts a smoky character to the final product. After roasting, the agave is crushed, fermented, and then distilled, resulting in a spirit with a wide range of flavors, including earthy, fruity, and herbal notes.\n\nThe traditional production methods involve cooking the agave in earthen pits lined with lava rocks and filled with wood and charcoal. This underground roasting process gives mezcal its distinctive smoky taste.\n\nMezcal is produced in specific regions of Mexico, with Oaxaca being a particularly renowned area for its high-quality mezcals. The production of mezcal is regulated, and the spirit has a Denomination of Origin (DO) to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\nUnlike some other agave spirits, such as tequila, which is made from Blue Agave, mezcal can be produced from a variety of agave types, contributing to the spirit's diversity.\n\nMezcal is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and has gained international recognition for its artisanal production methods and diverse flavor profile.",

      "description": "Amaro Averna is the most popular cocktail amaro in the amber, bittersweet style that makes up much of the “common” amari stocked on shelves. Because of this, Averna is often one of the easiest bottles to procure, and may be used as a substitute in a pinch for other harder to find styles like Montenegro, Ramazzotti, and Ciociaro. Most folks will tell you that “each amaro is different” and effectively—yes—this is true, but many amari will substitute for one-another just fine, with the understanding that the drink will be subtly different.",

It is a dark brown liquid made from a secret blend of herbs and spices, created by the House of Angostura in Trinidad and Tobago. Despite its name, Angostura bitters does not contain angostura bark; instead, it features a proprietary combination of botanical ingredients.\n\nAngostura bitters typically comes in small bottles with a distinctive oversized label and a built-in dasher top, allowing for controlled and precise pouring.\n\nDespite the name, Angostura bitters is non-alcoholic in the sense that it is not consumed in large quantities and is used as a flavoring agent rather than a beverage on its own.\n\nAngostura bitters has become an iconic and essential ingredient in the world of cocktails, appreciated for its ability to elevate and enhance the overall drinking experience.",
