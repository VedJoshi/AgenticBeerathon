  "description": "Although the origin of the drink is unknown, one account says it came about around 1918 in the region of Alentejo in Portugal, with a popular recipe made with lemon, garlic, and honey, indicated for patients with the Spanish flu. Another account is that Caipirinha is based on Poncha, an alcoholic drink from Madeira, Portugal. The main ingredient is aguardente de cana, which is made from sugar cane. Sugar cane production was switched from Madeira to Brazil by the Portuguese as they needed more land to plant it on. Before this people in Madeira had already created aguardente de cana, which was the ancestor to cachaça.\n\nVariations:\n\n**CAIPIROSKA** – Instead of Cachaça use Vodka;",

      "description": "Cachaça (pronounced ka-SHAH-suh) is a Brazilian distilled spirit made from fermented sugarcane juice. It is a key ingredient in the famous Brazilian cocktail, the Caipirinha. Cachaça is often compared to rum, but there are distinct differences in the production process and flavor profile.\n\nCachaça is classified based on aging:\n- White (Prata or Silver): Unaged or briefly aged, maintaining a clear appearance.\n- Gold (Ouro): Aged cachaça, which takes on a golden hue from the wooden barrels.\n- Premium/Extra Aged (Extra Premium or Extra Envelhecida): Aged for an extended period, often in exotic wood barrels.\n\nCachaça holds cultural significance in Brazil and is enjoyed in various ways, from sipping neat to being used as a base spirit in cocktails. It has gained international recognition for its unique production methods and the distinct flavors it brings to mixology.",
