  "description": "The Hurricane was created in New Orleans back in the 1940s. It was created out of necessity, when whiskey was in short supply due to the war. Rum was in abundance, and some suppliers would only sell a case of whiskey if it was accompanied by two cases of rum. Bars then had plenty of rum on hand, which forced them to get creative to move the stock!This drink is large and boozy but you can always halve the measurements for a more responsible version.",

      "description": "Dark rum is a type of rum that is aged longer and often in charred barrels, giving it a darker color and a richer, more robust flavor compared to lighter rums. It typically has notes of caramel, molasses, and sometimes spices. Dark rum is commonly used in cocktails, especially those with a strong, flavorful profile, and it is also enjoyed neat or on the rocks. The aging process contributes to the development of complex flavors and a smoother texture.",
