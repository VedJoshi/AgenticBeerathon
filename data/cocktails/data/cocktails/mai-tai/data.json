  "description": "The Mai Tai has a mixed up history. Reaching its height of popularity in the 50s and 60s, it is the quintessential tiki drink. Tiki trendsetters Don the Beachcomber and Trader Vic both claim to have invented the cocktail, though their versions are distinctly different. Over time all kinds of fruity concoctions have been whipped up under the name of Mai Tai, no doubt, in all the colors of the rainbow. Although itself slightly modified, due to availability of ingredients, Trader Vic’s ‘Original” Mai Tai reigns supreme.",

      "description": "Dark rum is a type of rum that is aged longer and often in charred barrels, giving it a darker color and a richer, more robust flavor compared to lighter rums. It typically has notes of caramel, molasses, and sometimes spices. Dark rum is commonly used in cocktails, especially those with a strong, flavorful profile, and it is also enjoyed neat or on the rocks. The aging process contributes to the development of complex flavors and a smoother texture.",
