  "description": "Named for a historic hotel in midtown Manhattan, the classic Algonquin cocktail combines rye whiskey, vermouth and pineapple. At Clyde Common in Portland, Oregon, bartender Banjo Amberg uses Bianco vermouth instead of dry and pineapple gomme syrup instead of fresh juice for a more elegant version of the original. “Nobody likes the Algonquin. It was one of those drinks that was so unpopular that nobody that I know even tried to make it work, like you can do with so many of those forgotten ‘classics,’ ” says Amberg. “With a few adjustments we stumbled upon something truly delicious.”",

      "description": "Rye whiskey is a type of whiskey made primarily from rye grain. To be labeled as rye whiskey in the United States, the mash (grain mixture fermented to make alcohol) must be composed of at least 51% rye. The remaining ingredients in the mash can include other grains such as corn and barley. Rye whiskey is aged in new charred oak barrels, and the final product must be distilled to no more than 160 proof and entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof.\n\nAmerican rye whiskey tends to have a spicier and more robust flavor profile compared to bourbon, which is primarily made from corn.\n\nIn Canada, the term \"rye\" is often used broadly and doesn't necessarily mean that the whiskey is made predominantly from rye grain. Canadian rye whisky can contain a mix of grains, and the flavor profile may vary. Some Canadian whiskies labeled as \"rye\" are made with little or no rye content.\n\nRye whiskey is known for its distinctive taste, which can include spicy, fruity, and sometimes peppery notes. It can be enjoyed neat, on the rocks, or used in various cocktails such as the classic Manhattan or Old Fashioned.",

      "description": "First launched way back in 1910, Bianco is a wonderful style of vermouth. First inspired by the white flowers of vanilla plants, the bottling has been nicknamed ‘Bianchissimo’, meaning “the whitest of the white”.\n\nWhilst it looks like a dry vermouth, this is a sweeter style, which offers flavours of juicy citrus, berries, peaches and apricots, some mixed herbs, a touch of charcoal, vanilla, honey, apples, and some faint herby bitterness.\n\nDelicate and well balanced, this vermouth is a bartender’s dream, offering sweet complexity that is perfect in White Negronis and Martini style drinks.",
