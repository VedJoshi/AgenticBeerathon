  "description": "The Industry Sour was created by St. Louis bartender Ted Kilgore in 2011. By his own account, it was created for another industry person and the thought going into it was simply “what would happen if I put all my favorite things into one drink” usually this thought leads nowhere good but on this occasion it created a legendary drink.",
