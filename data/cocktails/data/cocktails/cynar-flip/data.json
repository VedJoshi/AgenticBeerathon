Flips are characterized by their smooth and frothy texture, achieved by vigorously shaking or \"flipping\" the ingredients, which incorporates air and emulsifies the egg.\n\nThe ingredients are shaken together without ice first (a \"dry shake\") to emulsify the egg, and then ice is added for a second round of shaking to chill the mixture. The final drink is strained into a glass, and a sprinkle of nutmeg on top is a common finishing touch.",
