  "description": "We went nearly a century before a handful of rowdy boozehounds in NYC decided the Negroni needed more gin and less of everything else, but it took less than a decade for those same bartenders to tinker with Collins' White Negroni. I think that was a mistake. \n\nWhile a classic Negroni can very easily handle an increase in gin to punch through the Campari and sweet red vermouth, there is far less sugar for the gin to fight in a White Negroni, rendering an increase of gin unnecessary and oftentimes detrimental. \n\nThe best version of this cocktail then, in my opinion, adheres to the original Negroni format, stays true to the original White Negroni flavor profile, and improves upon the original.",

      "description": "Gin is a distilled alcoholic beverage that derives its predominant flavor from juniper berries and other botanicals. It falls under the category of distilled spirits and is known for its diverse and complex flavor profile, which can include herbal, floral, citrus, and spicy notes. The production of gin involves distilling a neutral spirit with botanicals, with juniper being the key botanical required for a spirit to be classified as gin.\n\nThe defining characteristic of gin is the prominent presence of juniper berries in its flavor profile. The name \"gin\" is derived from the French word \"genièvre,\" meaning juniper.\n\nThere are several styles of gin, including London Dry Gin, Plymouth Gin, and New Western or Contemporary-style Gin. Each style has its own production methods and regulations.\n\nGin has a long history and has evolved over centuries, becoming one of the most popular and beloved spirits globally. Its association with a wide array of cocktails makes it a staple in bars and households alike.\n\nHistorical note: dry gin was not really part of the American bar until the 1890s. All references to “gin” before this period are to genever. The other gin of that era was “old tom gin”, which was nearly always refered to as such or as “tom gin”.",

First inspired by the white flowers of vanilla plants, the bottling has been nicknamed ‘Bianchissimo’, meaning “the whitest of the white”.\n\nWhilst it looks like a dry vermouth, this is a sweeter style, which offers flavours of juicy citrus, berries, peaches and apricots, some mixed herbs, a touch of charcoal, vanilla, honey, apples, and some faint herby bitterness.\n\nDelicate and well balanced, this vermouth is a bartender’s dream, offering sweet complexity that is perfect in White Negronis and Martini style drinks.",
