  "description": "A classic first illustrated in Charles H. Baker’s The Gentlemen’s Companion, the Mexican Firing Squad is a tequila cocktail that deserves attention. It’s served at Ward III in New York City, where bartender Kenneth McCoy says he added it to his summer menu because “it’s fun and delicious and a bit more under the radar than a Margarita or a Paloma.”",

      "description": "Tequila is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of the blue agave plant, primarily grown in the Jalisco region of Mexico. The production of tequila is regulated by Mexican law, specifying the geographical areas where it can be produced and the methods used in its production.\n\nTequila Blanco, also known as Tequila Silver or Tequila Plata, is a type of tequila that is typically unaged or aged for a very short period. It is the purest expression of the blue agave flavor, as it is not influenced by the characteristics of aging in oak barrels.\n\nBlanco tequila is a popular choice for those who want to experience the true essence of the agave plant without the influence of aging. It provides a lively and authentic representation of tequila's primary ingredient.",

      "description": "Angostura bitters is a concentrated bitters (herbal alcoholic preparation) and highly aromatic flavoring agent used in the preparation of cocktails and various culinary applications. It is a dark brown liquid made from a secret blend of herbs and spices, created by the House of Angostura in Trinidad and Tobago. Despite its name, Angostura bitters does not contain angostura bark; instead, it features a proprietary combination of botanical ingredients.\n\nAngostura bitters typically comes in small bottles with a distinctive oversized label and a built-in dasher top, allowing for controlled and precise pouring.\n\nDespite the name, Angostura bitters is non-alcoholic in the sense that it is not consumed in large quantities and is used as a flavoring agent rather than a beverage on its own.\n\nAngostura bitters has become an iconic and essential ingredient in the world of cocktails, appreciated for its ability to elevate and enhance the overall drinking experience.",
