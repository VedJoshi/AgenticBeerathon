  "description": "The story of the Americano dates back to the second half of the 1800s in Gaspare Campari’s bar in Milan.  Over the years the cocktail acquires notoriety thanks to some homages from the world of cinema, including James Bond (007 Casino Royale) whose favorite cocktail was, precisely, the Americano.\n\nThe nickname “American” was born when Primo Carnera, a giant Italian boxer, became world heavyweight champion at Madison Square Garden in New York.  When Carnera returned to Italy with the title, he was greeted with this very Italian cocktail which, for the occasion, was called “Americano”.\n\nThe Americano entered the IBA Cocktail List only in 1987 but, in reality, it was a cocktail that spread all over Italy during the 1930s.",

      "description": "Club soda is a manufactured form of carbonated water, commonly used as a drink mixer. Also known as soda, siphon soda water, soda water, siphon soda, and siphon water.\n\nSoda water is artificially or naturally carbonated water, to which mineral salts have been added. The product without the salts is termed \"seltzer\" or \"seltzer water.\"\n\nCarbonated water with added minerals—commonly sodium bicarbonate or salt—club soda was designed to approximate mineral water, which is often naturally fizzy, but can carry a hefty price tag. English chemist Joseph Priestly invented the process of carbonation in 1767, when he realized that the carbon dioxide produced during the fermentation of beer could be infused into water. Soon after, Jacob Schweppe, a Swiss watchmaker, figured out how to manufacture carbonated water (which has no added minerals) and club soda. These products would become the cornerstone of the Schweppes Company, which is still in existence today. The added salt or sodium bicarbonate helps to mitigate the sour flavors from the carbonic acid, a byproduct of carbon dioxide.",
