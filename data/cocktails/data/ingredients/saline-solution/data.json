  "description": "20% saline\n\nSaline solution, often simply referred to as salt solution, is a mixture of water and sodium chloride (salt). It's a surprisingly versatile ingredient, primarily used to enhance and balance flavors rather than contribute a distinct taste of its own. The precise ratio of salt to water can be adjusted to achieve different levels of intensity, though a standard ratio is typically employed. It's a fundamental component in many culinary applications beyond beverages, often used to season food and create brines.\n\nBeyond its simple composition, saline solution plays a crucial role in manipulating perceived sweetness and acidity. A small addition can soften harsh edges and create a more rounded, palatable experience. It's important to note that the quality of the salt used significantly impacts the final product; finer salts generally dissolve more readily and provide a more consistent result. The ingredient is often used to create a 'salty' rim for glasses, or to add a subtle savory note to drinks.",
