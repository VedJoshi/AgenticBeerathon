  "description": "Olive brine, most famously associated with the Dirty Martini, is the salty, savory liquid found in jars of olives. In cocktails, it serves as a powerful seasoning, adding a briny, umami depth and a subtle saltiness that can round out flavors and enhance the perception of other ingredients. A small amount of olive brine can transform a drink, cutting through richness and providing a distinctive, savory counterpoint, particularly effective with gin or vodka to create a well-balanced, piquantly flavored libation.",
