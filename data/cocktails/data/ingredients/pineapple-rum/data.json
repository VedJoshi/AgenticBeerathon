  "description": "Pineapple rum is a captivating blend of Caribbean tradition and tropical fruit essence. It begins with a base of high-quality rum, typically aged to impart a smooth, mellow character. This rum is then infused with the vibrant flavor of pineapple, often utilizing juice or extract to achieve a rich, fruity profile. The resulting spirit offers a complex interplay of warm, molasses notes from the rum, balanced by the bright, tangy sweetness of the pineapple. It's a versatile ingredient, appreciated for its distinct flavor and aromatic complexity.",
