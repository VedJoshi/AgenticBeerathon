  "description": "Punt e Mes is a bittersweet Italian aperitivo, originating in Turin, Italy. The name itself translates to 'one and two,' referencing the original ratio of sweet vermouth to Campari used in its creation. It's a complex blend of botanicals, spices, and citrus peels, resulting in a uniquely layered flavor profile that balances bitterness with subtle sweetness and aromatic depth. The precise recipe remains a closely guarded secret, but it's known to include ingredients like gentian root, cinchona bark, and various citrus fruits.\n\nPunt e Mes offers a distinctive taste experience, characterized by a pronounced bitterness that isn't overpowering, but rather balanced by a gentle sweetness and a lingering herbal complexity. It's often enjoyed neat or with a splash of soda water, and its versatility lends itself well to experimentation with other mixers. The ingredient is known for its rich texture and full-bodied mouthfeel, making it a satisfying and sophisticated choice for those seeking an alternative to more common aperitifs.\n\nPunt e Mes is a relatively strong aperitivo, reflecting its Campari base. It's a key ingredient for those looking to add a touch of Italian flair to their drinks program, and its unique flavor profile sets it apart from other bitter components.",
