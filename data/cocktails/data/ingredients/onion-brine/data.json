  "description": "Onion brine, typically from pickled pearl onions, is a distinctive ingredient in cocktails, most famously in the Gibson Martini where it replaces olive brine. It introduces a savory, slightly tangy, and subtly sweet or even spicy (depending on the pickling spices) umami note to drinks, providing a unique counterpoint to the spirit's botanicals. A small dash of onion brine can add depth and complexity, transforming a classic cocktail into a more intriguing, savory experience.",
