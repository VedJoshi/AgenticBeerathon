  "description": "Génépy (or Génépi) is a traditional herbal liqueur from the Alpine regions of France and Italy, made from a variety of aromatic mountain plants, primarily Artemisia (a genus that includes wormwood). It has a complex, herbaceous flavor with notes of chamomile, mint, pine, and subtle sweetness, often compared to Chartreuse but with a more delicate and floral profile. The liqueur’s signature golden-green hue comes from the infusion of these alpine herbs.\n\nIf you're looking for a substitute, a mild herbal liqueur like Dolin Génépy des Alpes, Yellow Chartreuse, or even a mix of Green Chartreuse and a floral liqueur (like St-Germain) can work in cocktails that call for Génépy.",
