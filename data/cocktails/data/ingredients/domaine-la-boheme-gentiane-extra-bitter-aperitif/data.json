  "strength": 20,
  "description": "A natural wine based aperitif from cult wine maker Patrick Bouju. Being based in the Auvergne, where traditional medicinal plants like gentian and other bitter roots and botanicals thrive, it was a natural leap for Patrick to make this special liqueur. More like a great vermouth or ancient wine based liqueur than any other modern reference, this is best sipped slowly with a slight chill. Extraordinary and like everything else from this small artisan producer, quite limited.",
