  "description": "Fino sherry is a dry, pale, and delicate fortified wine from Spainâ€™s Jerez region, known for its light body and crisp, nutty flavor. It is aged under a layer of flor (a protective yeast) in a process called biological aging, which prevents oxidation and gives it a fresh, slightly saline taste. This method results in a sherry that is bone-dry with notes of almonds, green apples, fresh bread, and a hint of sea breeze.",
