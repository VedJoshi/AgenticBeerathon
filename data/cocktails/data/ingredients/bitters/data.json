  "description": "Bitters are concentrated alcoholic tinctures made by infusing a high-proof spirit with a diverse array of botanicals, including aromatic herbs, roots, fruits, spices, and barks. While often containing bittering agents like gentian or cinchona, they are not solely bitter; rather, they serve as a highly concentrated seasoning for cocktails, used in very small quantities (typically dashes or drops). Their purpose is to enhance and balance flavors, add aromatic complexity, and sometimes provide a unifying bridge between disparate ingredients in a drink.\n\nThere's a vast spectrum of bitters available, ranging from classic aromatic bitters like Angostura and Peychaud's (which offer notes of baking spices, citrus, and a hint of bitterness) to orange bitters, and an ever-growing variety of \"new wave\" or \"craft\" bitters featuring specific flavors such as chocolate, celery, or various fruit and floral notes. Despite their small volume in a drink, bitters are considered an indispensable ingredient in mixology, often referred to as the \"salt and pepper\" of the cocktail world, due to their profound impact on a drink's overall character and balance.",
