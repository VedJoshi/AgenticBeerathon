  "description": "Sparkling wine, encompassing everything from Champagne and Prosecco to Cava and Cremant, is a dynamic and essential component in cocktails, primarily valued for its effervescence and ability to add a celebratory lift. Beyond just bubbles, it contributes varying degrees of sweetness, acidity, and specific flavor notesâ€”be it the crisp apple of Prosecco, the yeasty complexity of Champagne, or the citrusy brightness of Cava. In cocktails, sparkling wine lightens heavier spirits, extends refreshing drinks, and adds a luxurious texture, making it perfect for spritzes, fizzes, and iconic drinks like the French 75 or Mimosa, instantly elevating the perceived sophistication and occasion of a drink.",
