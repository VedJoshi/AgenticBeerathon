  "description": "Ancho Reyes is a brand of chile liqueur produced in Puebla City, Mexico, based on a 1927 recipe from the same city. The liqueur is made from and named after Puebla's renowned ancho chiles, a dried form of ripe poblano peppers.\n\nThe company produces two types of chile liqueur: the original, red Ancho Reyes liqueur and the newer, green Ancho Reyes Verde liqueur. The liqueur is produced using late harvest chiles that have sun-dried for 2 to 3 weeks. For the Verde version of the drink, early harvested fire-roasted poblano chiles are used in addition to the sun-dried chiles.\n\nBoth the red and green liqueurs are 40% ABV and are popular for adding a bit of spice to classic drinks like a margarita or a Paloma.",
