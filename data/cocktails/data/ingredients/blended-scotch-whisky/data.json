  "description": "Blended scotch is a generic category for whisky made in Scotland, combining aged, single malt scotch whiskies (typically from multiple distilleries) with grain neutral spirits for a lighter, milder flavor. Historically, the aims of blended scotch are smoothness, approachability, and taste profile consistency across potentially large volumes over time (very difficult to maintain for several reasons).",
