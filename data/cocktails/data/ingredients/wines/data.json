  "description": "Wines, in the context of cocktails, extend beyond just the sparkling varieties, offering a diverse palette of flavors and textures. Still wines—red, white, and rosé—can contribute acidity, fruit notes, tannins, and body, allowing for lower-alcohol drinks or a nuanced complexity not easily achieved with spirits alone. Fortified wines like Sherry and Port are particularly versatile, adding richness, nuttiness, or oxidative notes that can elevate a cocktail's depth and mouthfeel, often acting as a bridge between spirits and other ingredients. While often used for spritzers or Sangrias, modern mixology increasingly explores wine's full potential to create sophisticated, balanced, and unique libations.",
