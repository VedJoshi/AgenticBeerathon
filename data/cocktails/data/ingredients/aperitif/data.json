  "description": "Aperitif/digestif bitters is a generic category for bitter-sweet spirit- or wine-based beverage bitters. Consumed straight or in mixed drinks in larger proportions than aromatic bitters or fruit bitters. Prominent examples are Amer Picon, Fernet Branca, Unicum, and Campari.\n\nNearly all aperitif/digestif bitters are complex, proprietary formulas and even products that aim to copy better-known brands tend to noticeably distinct. Factoring the extreme flavor potency of all these liqueurs, none are true substitutes for each other, but often, with careful discretion, not willy-nilly, one can be substituted for a similar one to different (but satisfying) effect.",
