  "description": "Amaro (plural: Amari) is a broad category of bittersweet Italian herbal liqueurs, with \"amaro\" literally meaning \"bitter\" in Italian. These spirits are traditionally consumed as a digestif after meals, believed to aid digestion.\n\nAmaro is made by macerating (soaking) a complex, often secret, blend of botanicals—including herbs, roots, flowers, bark, and citrus peels—in an alcohol base (often neutral spirits or wine/grape brandy). This infusion is then typically sweetened with sugar syrup and aged, sometimes for extended periods.\n\nThe flavor profiles of amari are incredibly diverse, ranging from intensely bitter and medicinal to more subtle, sweet, and citrusy. Common tasting notes can include anything from gentian, cinchona, rhubarb, and wormwood (for bitterness) to orange peel, mint, licorice, caramel, and various baking spices. Each amaro brand offers a unique character, often reflecting the regional ingredients and traditional recipes of its origin.\n\nIn cocktails, amari are prized for their ability to add depth, complexity, and a balancing bittersweet note. They can act as a bridge between other ingredients, provide a backbone of bitterness, or introduce intriguing herbal and aromatic layers.",
