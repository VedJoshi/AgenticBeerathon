  "description": "Teranino is a unique Croatian liqueur produced with fruit or pomace brandy and red wine made from Teran varietyâ€”hence the name. This liqueur is usually sweetened and flavored with various botanicals such as cinnamon, cloves, star anise, lemon, vanilla, or fennel.\n\nThe result is a ruby red liqueur with an earthy and herbaceous character, fruity notes, and sweet, spicy aromas. Teranino is sweet and typically has between 15 to 20% ABV. It is best to serve it chilled and enjoy it as an aperitif or a digestif. Teranino can be served neat or on the rocks.\n\nThis traditional liqueur is mainly produced in Istria, where Teran is one of the most common red grape varieties.",
