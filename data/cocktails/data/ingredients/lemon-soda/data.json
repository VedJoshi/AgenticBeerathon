  "description": "In the cocktail world, \"lemon soda\" typically refers to a simple, refreshing mixer. It's essentially lemon-flavored sparkling water, often used to add a bubbly, citrusy lift to \nvarious drinks. Think of it as a lighter alternative to regular soda, providing a clean, tart counterpoint to stronger spirits like gin, vodka, or rum. It's a versatile ingredient, \nfrequently found in classics like a Gin Rickey or a Vodka Soda, and allows for a bright, crisp finish without overpowering the main flavors.",
