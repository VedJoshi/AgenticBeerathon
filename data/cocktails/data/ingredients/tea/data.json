  "description": "Tea offers a versatile and sophisticated dimension to cocktails, introducing complex flavors and aromas that range from earthy and smoky to floral, fruity, or tannic. It can be incorporated in various ways: brewed and chilled as a mixer, steeped into syrups for concentrated flavor and sweetness, or used to infuse spirits directly for a nuanced base. Tea allows for creative experimentation, adding depth, balancing sweetness or acidity, and providing unique aromatic notes that elevate a drink beyond traditional profiles, making it a favorite tool for modern mixologists seeking to craft unique and memorable libations.",
